                <p>Alan Mathison Turing OBE FRS (/ˈtjʊərɪŋ/; 23 June 1912 – 7 June 1954) was an English mathematician,
                    computer
                    scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist.[6][7] Turing was highly
                    influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the
                    concepts of
                    algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a
                    general-purpose
                    computer.[8][9][10] Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and
                    artificial intelligence.[11] Despite these accomplishments, he was never fully recognised in his
                    home
                    country during his lifetime due to the prevalence of homophobia at the time and because much of his
                    work
                    was
                    covered by the Official Secrets Act.</p>

                <p>During the Second World War, Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) at
                    Bletchley
                    Park, Britain's codebreaking centre that produced Ultra intelligence. For a time he led Hut 8, the
                    section
                    that was responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. Here, he devised a number of techniques for
                    speeding
                    the breaking of German ciphers, including improvements to the pre-war Polish bombe method, an
                    electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine.</p>

                <p>Turing played a crucial role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat
                    the
                    Nazis in many crucial engagements, including the Battle of the Atlantic, and in so doing helped win
                    the
                    war.[12][13] Due to the problems of counterfactual history, it is hard to estimate the precise
                    effect
                    Ultra
                    intelligence had on the war,[14] but at the upper end it has been estimated that this work shortened
                    the
                    war
                    in Europe by more than two years and saved over 14 million lives.[12]</p>

                <p>After the war, Turing worked at the National Physical Laboratory, where he designed the Automatic
                    Computing
                    Engine. The Automatic Computing Engine was one of the first designs for a stored-program computer.
                    In
                    1948,
                    Turing joined Max Newman's Computing Machine Laboratory, at the Victoria University of Manchester,
                    where
                    he
                    helped develop the Manchester computers[15] and became interested in mathematical biology. He wrote
                    a
                    paper
                    on the chemical basis of morphogenesis[1] and predicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the
                    Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction, first observed in the 1960s.</p>

                <p>Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts; the Labouchere Amendment of 1885 had mandated that
                    "gross
                    indecency" was a criminal offence in the UK. He accepted chemical castration treatment, with DES, as
                    an
                    alternative to prison. Turing died in 1954, 16 days before his 42nd birthday, from cyanide
                    poisoning. An
                    inquest determined his death as a suicide, but it has been noted that the known evidence is also
                    consistent
                    with accidental poisoning.</p>

                <p>In 2009, following an Internet campaign, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown made an official public
                    apology
                    on behalf of the British government for "the appalling way he was treated". Queen Elizabeth II
                    granted
                    Turing a posthumous pardon in 2013. The "Alan Turing law" is now an informal term for a 2017 law in
                    the
                    United Kingdom that retroactively pardoned men cautioned or convicted under historical legislation
                    that
                    outlawed homosexual acts.[16]</p>
